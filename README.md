# üöÄ SpaceX Launch Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository showcases an end-to-end data analysis pipeline using historical SpaceX launch data retrieved from the [SpaceX API](https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches/past). The project involves data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling to understand and predict the success of SpaceX launches.

## üìä Key Features  

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Collected SpaceX past launches data via API integration using `https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches/past`.  
   - Cleaned and structured the data for meaningful analysis.

2. **Interactive Visualization**  
   - **Folium App**: Created an interactive map to display launch sites and outcomes dynamically.  
   - **Plotly Dash App**: An interactive dashboard for exploratory data analysis and insights visualization.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Conducted detailed analysis to explore relationships between variables and uncover patterns.  
   - Generated key visualizations using tools like `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `Plotly`.

4. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Built a **Logistic Regression** model to predict the success of launches based on relevant features.  
   - Evaluated the model's performance using a **confusion matrix**, showcasing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üöÄ Project Highlights  

### 1. Data Wrangling  
- Retrieved launch data directly from the SpaceX API.  
- Cleaned missing or inconsistent data and prepared the dataset for analysis.

### 2. Interactive Folium App  
- Mapped the launch sites and visually represented successful vs. unsuccessful launches.

### 3. EDA and Insights  
- Explored relationships between variables like payload mass, launch site, and orbit type.  
- Identified factors influencing launch success rates.

### 4. Predictive Modeling and Evaluation  
- Used logistic regression to predict launch success based on historical data.  
- Evaluated the model's performance with a **confusion matrix** and derived key metrics.
